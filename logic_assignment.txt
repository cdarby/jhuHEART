Your assignment for class on Nov. 1st is necessary to prepare you for our in-class activities. You will become familiar with Boolean logic and circuits, described in The Golden Ticket chapter 7 (pg. 113-118).

1. Find brief definitions of these terms and be able to give an example, when applicable.  

Boolean logic (1's and 0's)  
Boolean arithmetic (add, multiply)   
Boolean operators ("AND", "OR", "NOT")  
Truth table    
Boolean circuits ("AND", "OR", "NOT")   


2. Expand your research to include at least one of these topics:  

Connections between Boolean formulae and circuits  
Connections to Venn diagrams   
Boolean formula (or circuit) satisfiability  
Boolean operators ("NAND","NOR","XOR")  

- Look for videos, "question-answer" boards, and textbook-like tutorials online. University course notes and slides may also be helpful advanced resources.
- I encourage you to take notes on your research and bring them to class.  
- Bring lingering questions to class, do research with your classmates, and email me at any time.
- No written work will be collected, but you will be evaluated on the quality of your questions and the knowledge you demonstrate in class.
