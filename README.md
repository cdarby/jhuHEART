# HEART: Exploring algorithms for hard problems in computer science
Wednesdays 3:00 - 4:15pm, [Latrobe Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Johns+Hopkins+University+-+Latrobe+Hall/@39.327737,-76.6208283,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xf0051bbb754e3351!8m2!3d39.327737!4d-76.6208283) 107  
September 14 2017 â€“ November 30 2017 (except Oct 18 and Nov 22)  Instructor: Charlotte Darby `cdarby at jhu.edu` 

## Summary
Many important optimization problems across engineering disciplines have been classified by computer scientists as computationally "hard" to solve. In this course, we'll step up to the challenge and work through the theoretical background of some of these famous problems and learn about algorithms developed to tackle them. We'll focus on graph problems, including Traveling Salesman, path-finding and graph coloring, with lessons based around visual representations and interactive activities.  

## Policy
These courses meet weekly for ten weeks in 90-minute sessions. Students in these tutorials are graded on a pass/fail basis only. Workload may include readings, presentations, and active participation in class, however no written work (such as papers or problem sets) may be assigned. Attendance is mandatory.  
[Note: Excused absences for illness, religious holiday, emergency should be discussed with the instructor. If you have sports or an extracurricular activity that may cause you to miss class, I encourage you to still take a HEART class but register for a different section.]

## Course Materials
Please get [The golden ticket: P, NP, and the search for the impossible](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-golden-ticket-lance-fortnow/1113861209) (Lance Fortnow). Readings will be assigned before and after related class sessions. E-book is fine, [JHU library has it](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-golden-ticket-lance-fortnow/1113861209) but there may be a limited number of electronic copies.
